## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts an individual's income based on a set of features. This prediction problem involves regression, as we're trying to predict a continuous numerical value (income) for each individual.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various features such as age, education level, occupation, marital status, and more. The target variable is the individual's income. Unfortunately, I can't provide a direct link to the dataset as my browsing capability is disabled, but you can mention where you obtained the dataset from.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Sujgaik2003/IncomePred/edit/main/README.md`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd IncomePred `
3. Set up a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In the Jupyter notebook `IncomePrediction.ipynb`, you'll find exploratory data analysis of the dataset. This includes visualizations, summary statistics, and insights into the relationships between features and income.

## Feature Engineering

The notebook `IncomePrediction.ipynb` covers the process of feature selection, transformation, and creation. Effective feature engineering can greatly enhance the performance of your prediction model.

## Model Selection

In the `IncomePrediction.ipynb` notebook, we compare different regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to find the best-performing model for our income prediction task.

## Training and Evaluation

The `IncomePrediction.ipynb` notebook delves into the training and evaluation of the selected model. It includes techniques like cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and performance metrics calculation.
